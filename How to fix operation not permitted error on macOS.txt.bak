I was getting opendir operation not permitted error from rsync on macOS Catalina.

The command I was using: rsync -vaE --progress /Volumes/SourceName /Volumes/DestinationName

I have fixed this error by giving Full Disk Access to Terminal and to /usr/bin/rsync. Tip: You can use CMD + Shift + G to choose the folder of rsync in System Preferences - Security & Privacy.
